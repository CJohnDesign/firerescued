   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   # Edit .env file with your credentials
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   # If using Supabase (recommended)
   python -m app.database.supabase
   
   # Or create a test account with sample data
   python create_test_account.py
   ```

### Running the Application

**Development mode**
```bash
python run.py
```

**Production mode**
```bash
gunicorn 'app:create_app()' --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

## WHOOP API Setup

1. Create a developer account at [WHOOP Developer Portal](https://developer.whoop.com/)
2. Register a new application
3. Set your redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/` (development) or your production URL
4. Add your client ID and secret to the `.env` file

## Supabase Setup

Refer to [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your Supabase project.

## OpenAI Setup

1. Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Generate an API key
3. Add the key to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Usage Guide

1. **Account Setup**
   - Sign up for an account
   - Connect your WHOOP account via OAuth

2. **Daily Usage**
   - View your health metrics dashboard
   - Log your daily mood (1-10 scale)
   - Check your burnout risk score

3. **Analysis**
   - Explore trend charts
   - View correlations between metrics
   - Get AI-powered insights and recommendations

4. **Settings**
   - Configure integrations
   - Manage notification preferences
   - Update AI model settings

## Data Privacy & Security

- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Supabase provides enterprise-grade security for cloud storage
- Local SQLite option available for complete privacy
- OpenAI API calls follow strict data minimization principles
- No third-party analytics or tracking

## Deploying to Production

### ðŸš‚ Railway (Recommended)

**Railway is the perfect platform for Fire Rescued** because it natively supports Python Flask applications with all features intact.

âœ… **What works perfectly on Railway:**
- Full Flask application with all routes
- Background APScheduler for WHOOP data fetching
- Database connections to Supabase
- Environment variables and secrets management
- Real-time logging and monitoring
- Automatic deployments from GitHub

**Quick Deploy:**
1. Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy automatically!

### Alternative: Vercel (Advanced Users)

Due to Vercel's serverless function size limitations with Python projects, there are two deployment approaches:

### Option 1: Simple Landing Page Deployment

This approach deploys a simple landing page as a placeholder for your full application:

1. **Navigate to the minimal deployment directory**
   ```bash
   cd vercel-deploy
   ```

2. **Install Vercel CLI and login**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy the landing page**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

The result will be a simple landing page that serves as a placeholder for your full application. You can view the deployed site at: https://vercel-deploy-ksuk0zgjy-wesley-wesleydaltons-projects.vercel.app

### Option 2: Full Application Deployment (Advanced)

For the full application to work on Vercel, you would need to:

1. **Split your application into smaller functions**
   - Restructure the app into API routes
   - Use frontend-only components where possible

2. **Use Vercel edge functions or middleware**
   - Convert Flask routes to serverless functions
   - Optimize package sizes

3. **Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard**
   - Go to your project settings in the Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
   - Add all the required variables from your .env file

### Recommended Alternative

For a Python application of this complexity, consider alternatives like:
- Heroku
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Google Cloud Run
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

These platforms better support full Flask applications with their dependencies.
