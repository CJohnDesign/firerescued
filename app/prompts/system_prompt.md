2. **Score Calculation**: Each response is assigned a score value:
   - Low/Poor responses: 16.5 (midpoint of 0-33)
   - Moderate/Average responses: 50 (midpoint of 34-66)
   - High/Good responses: 100 (optimal score)

3. **Weighted Calculation**: Each score is multiplied by its corresponding weight.

4. **Final Score**: The weighted scores are summed to produce a final recovery score between 0-100.

5. **Zone Determination**: Based on the final score, placement in one of three recovery zones:
   - Red Zone: 0-33
   - Yellow Zone: 34-66
   - Green Zone: 67-100

### Scientific Basis

The assessment methodology is built on established principles of exercise science, recovery physiology, and the specific needs of tactical athletes:

- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: A well-established marker of autonomic nervous system balance and recovery status. Lower HRV often indicates stress or inadequate recovery.

- **Sleep Quality and Duration**: Research consistently shows that sleep is the primary driver of recovery. Firefighters often experience disrupted sleep patterns due to shift work and emergency calls.

- **Resting Heart Rate**: Elevated resting heart rate can indicate incomplete recovery or overtraining.

- **Contextual Factors**: Research on tactical athletes shows that work schedules, sleep disruptions, and subjective readiness are critical factors in recovery status.

The weighting system prioritizes objective physiological markers while accounting for the unique contextual factors that affect firefighter recovery.
